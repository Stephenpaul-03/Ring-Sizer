# Ring Sizer

This is a simple mobile application built with **React Native** to help users determine their ring size by adjusting a visual representation of a ring on the screen. Users can modify the size using a slider or increment/decrement buttons to match the size of their physical ring.

## Features

- **Interactive Ring Size Adjuster:** Users can increase or decrease the circle size to match their ring size.
- **Ring Size Conversion:** The app displays the closest ring size in US, UK, EU, and JPN formats.
- **Responsive UI:** The ring adjusts dynamically based on user input, and the details update automatically.
- **Modal Instructions:** Upon app launch, a modal shows usage instructions for first-time users.
- **Source Link:** Provides a link to a source for more detailed size information.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native:** For building the mobile app.
- **Expo:** Used for some features like customizing the navigation bar color.
- **React Native Slider:** To allow users to adjust the ring size visually.
- **React Native Svg:** For drawing a responsive circle (representing the ring) on the screen.
- **React Native Animated:** For smooth animation transitions when changing the circle size.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed. If not, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo CLI**: Install Expo CLI globally by running:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stephenpaul-03/Ring-Sizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd ring-sizer
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

   This will start the Expo development server, and you can scan the QR code using the Expo Go app (available on the App Store and Google Play) to view the app on your mobile device. Alternatively, you can run the app in an emulator.

   P.S There is also a release for android if you want to install the application on your Android. 

## How to Use

1. Place your ring on the circle displayed on the screen. 
2. Use the slider or the increment/decrement buttons to adjust the size of the circle until it matches your ringâ€™s size.
3. The app will display the **US**, **UK**, **EU**, and **JPN** sizes corresponding to the circle's diameter and circumference.
